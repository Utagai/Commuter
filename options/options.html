      (Anything that can help Google Maps locate the apartments you'll be
      looking at, in case they don't give enough information -- e.g., if your
      apartment site is strictly for NY, it will most likely omit the state
      from its addresses. Therefore, there could be two Delancey St. in the
      US, and the wrong one could be used for calculations.)
